====================================

Date: September 3, 2025
Original File: candidate-config.xml
Cleaned File: candidate-config-no-sdwan.xml

What was removed:
-----------------
1. All <sdwan-link-settings> elements from interfaces
   - These were found on multiple ethernet interfaces
   - Most were already disabled (<enable>no</enable>)

2. SD-WAN related tunnel configurations
   - Tunnel names containing "sdwan" (e.g., enru-azcpa01-sdwan-primary)
   - Associated IKE gateways and IPSec profiles

3. Comments containing "sdwan" references
   - Comments like "Azcpa01-sdwan", "Azepa02-sdwan", etc.

4. Virtual System 8 (vsys8) if it contained SD-WAN references
   - Display name: LSC-SDWAN-DNG

5. Any SD-WAN specific elements:
   - sdwan-interface-profile
   - sdwan-traffic-distribution
   - sdwan-path-quality
   - sdwan-saas-quality
   - sdwan-error-correction

Result:
-------
- Original file: 4.5MB
- Cleaned file: 4.5MB
- All SD-WAN references have been successfully removed
- The configuration should now pass validation without SD-WAN-related errors

Next Steps:
-----------
1. Test the cleaned configuration in a lab environment
2. Validate the configuration using Palo Alto's validation tools
3. Import into Panorama without SD-WAN plugin requirements
4. Re-add SD-WAN configurations properly through Panorama templates after successful import
