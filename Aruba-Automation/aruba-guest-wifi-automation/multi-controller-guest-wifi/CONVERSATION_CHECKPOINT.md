# Conversation Checkpoint - Multi-Controller Guest WiFi Automation

## Last Working Session: 2024-12-04

### üéØ Current State Summary

**What We Just Completed:**
1. Fixed v3 audit functionality - now correctly finds and displays passwords
2. Enhanced password update with visible entry and real-time progress
3. Corrected command sequence (exit twice, write memory, commit apply)
4. Created v4 for quick testing/verification

**User's Last Feedback:**
- "ok the v3 script worked great for the audit but it didn't seem to apply the new password"
- "I need to see the password typed in and then I need to see the status as it gets applied"
- "looks like you need to do exit, exit and then a write memory and then a commit apply"

### üî® What Still Needs Testing

1. **Password Update Verification**
   - User needs to test if the enhanced update process actually changes passwords
   - Verify the new command sequence works:
     ```
     configure terminal
     wlan ssid-profile CF_GUEST
     wpa-passphrase [new_password]
     exit
     exit
     write memory
     commit apply
     ```

2. **Post-Update Verification**
   - Run audit again to confirm new password is active
   - Test wireless client connection with new password
   - Check if changes persist after controller reboot

### üíª Current Scripts Status

**v3 (multi_controller_guest_wifi_v3.py)**
- ‚úÖ Audit works perfectly
- ‚úÖ Shows passwords being typed
- ‚úÖ Real-time command progress
- ‚ùì Password update needs testing with corrected sequence

**v4 (multi_controller_guest_wifi_v4.py)**
- ‚úÖ Quick parallel audit tool
- ‚úÖ Shows all passwords across controllers
- ‚úÖ Fast verification tool

### üîß Technical Context

- **Environment**: 20 Aruba virtual controllers v8.6.0.7 (no REST API)
- **Issue Solved**: Controllers block exec_command, must use invoke_shell
- **Working Commands**:
  - `show run | in CF_GUEST` - check if SSID exists
  - `show run no-encrypt | in wpa-passphrase` - get password
- **Network**: Controllers on 172.19.x.10 subnet
- **SSID**: CF_GUEST
- **Auth**: username "cfins", password "Catsm#0w"

### üìã Next Session Agenda

1. **Test Password Update**
   - Run v3 with update option
   - Verify all 7 steps execute properly
   - Check if passwords actually change

2. **If Update Works:**
   - Add post-update verification
   - Consider scheduled automation
   - Add email notifications

3. **If Update Fails:**
   - Capture exact error output
   - May need to adjust timing between commands
   - Might need different command sequence for virtual controllers

### üóÇÔ∏è Key Code Sections

**Password Update Method (v3, lines 143-196):**
- Shows each command being executed
- Waits 3 seconds between commands
- Checks for errors after each command
- Provides detailed logging

**Command Sequence (v3, lines 156-164):**
```python
commands = [
    "configure terminal",
    "wlan ssid-profile CF_GUEST", 
    f"wpa-passphrase {new_password}",
    "exit",  # Exit from wlan ssid-profile
    "exit",  # Exit from configure terminal
    "write memory",  # Save configuration first
    "commit apply"  # Then apply the changes
]
```

### üìù Quick Test Plan

1. Run v4 to see current passwords
2. Run v3 to update passwords
3. Run v4 again to verify change
4. Test client connection
5. Reboot one controller and re-verify

### üö® Important Notes

- Passwords are intentionally visible during entry for verification
- Script runs 3 controllers at a time (max_workers=3) to avoid overwhelming
- Each command waits 3 seconds for response
- Logs saved with timestamp in local logs directory
