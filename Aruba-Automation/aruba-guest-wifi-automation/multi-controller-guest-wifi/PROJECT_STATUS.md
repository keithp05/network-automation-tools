# Multi-Controller Guest WiFi Automation - Project Status

## Current Status (2024-12-04)

### ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Password Audit Functionality**
   - Successfully connects to all 20 Aruba virtual controllers via SSH
   - Uses `show run | in CF_GUEST` to check if SSID exists
   - Uses `show run no-encrypt | in wpa-passphrase` to get current password
   - Extracts actual passwords (e.g., "Spring2025") correctly
   - Runs all controllers in parallel for speed

2. **File Picker GUI**
   - Opens automatically when no config file specified
   - Allows selection of YAML configuration file
   - Works on Windows environment

3. **Password Update Process**
   - Shows password as typed (not hidden)
   - Displays real-time progress for each step
   - Uses correct command sequence:
     ```
     1. configure terminal
     2. wlan ssid-profile CF_GUEST
     3. wpa-passphrase [new_password]
     4. exit  (from wlan ssid-profile)
     5. exit  (from configure terminal)
     6. write memory
     7. commit apply
     ```

### üìÅ Available Scripts

1. **`multi_controller_guest_wifi_v3.py`** - Main production script
   - Full workflow: audit + update
   - GUI file picker
   - Detailed progress logging
   - Password visible during entry

2. **`multi_controller_guest_wifi_v4.py`** - Quick audit/test script
   - Fast parallel audit of all controllers
   - Shows passwords found
   - Good for testing/verification

### üîß Technical Details

- **Controllers**: 20 Aruba virtual controllers (version 8.6.0.7)
- **No REST API support** - using SSH/CLI commands only
- **Credentials**: username "cfins", password "Catsm#0w"
- **IP Range**: 172.19.x.10 subnet
- **SSID**: CF_GUEST

### üéØ Next Steps

1. **Verify Password Updates**
   - Test that passwords actually change on controllers
   - Confirm changes persist after controller reboot
   - Verify wireless clients can connect with new password

2. **Potential Enhancements**
   - Add verification step after update (re-check password)
   - Add rollback functionality if updates fail
   - Create scheduled task for automatic password rotation
   - Email notifications for password changes
   - Generate password history log

### üìù Usage

**For full workflow (audit + update):**
```bash
python3 multi_controller_guest_wifi_v3.py
```

**For quick audit only:**
```bash
python3 multi_controller_guest_wifi_v4.py
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

1. **SSH Timeout**: Some controllers may timeout if network is slow
2. **Command Output Truncation**: Fixed by waiting longer for complete responses
3. **"Only cli connections are allowed"**: Fixed by using invoke_shell instead of exec_command

### üîê Security Notes

- Passwords are shown in clear text during entry (by design for verification)
- Password logs are saved locally with timestamp
- Ensure proper file permissions on saved password files
